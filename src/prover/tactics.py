"""
Tactics for theorem proving.
A tactic transforms a proof state by applying logical rules.

Basic tactics:
- Rewrite: Replace subterm using an axiom or proven theorem
- Substitute: Substitute a variable with a term
- Simplify: Apply basic simplification rules
- Induction: Apply induction principle
- Split: Split conjunctions/disjunctions
